# clojure lemma

This repository is a work-in-progress to create a lemma library to connect clojure applications to [noam-io](https://github.com/noam-io).

## Installation

This lemma assumes an instance of the noam host server is installed and running. Follow the instructions at [noam-io](https://github.com/noam-io/host) to get noam up and running before running this lemma.

This project also requires the installation of java (currently only tested on 1.7 and higher) and clojure (1.6.0).

Check your current version and update as necessary:

    $ java -version

The Leiningen clojure dependency management tool is being used to develop this lemma. You can learn more and install it from the [Leiningen site](http://leiningen.org/).

## Usage

Once Leiningen has been installed, clone this repo:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jwettersten/clojure-lemma.git

cd into the root project-lemma directory and run:

    $ lein trampoline run

'trampoline' causes 'lein' to exit it's java process once the clojure lemma process is up and running. 'trampoline' is recommended for use with running this lemma as it ensures that ctrl-c triggers the lemma shutdown sequence on our lemma process vs. being caught by the running lein process.  

To stop the clojure lemma use ctrl-c.
